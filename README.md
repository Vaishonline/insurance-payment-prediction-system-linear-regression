# insurance-payment-prediction-system-linear-regression
<br>Machine learning model to predict whether a customer would pay the next premium in time or not using information about past  premium payment history for the policyholders along with their demographics (age, monthly income, area type) and sourcing channel. 
<br>I have used python programming language and implemented on Jupyter notebook. Data imported, cleaned (missing values and outliers), and visualized. 
<br>Univariate and bivariate analysis done before choosing the  algorithm, scaling the data, and tuning the hyperparameters.
